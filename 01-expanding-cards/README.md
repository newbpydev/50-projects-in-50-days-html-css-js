## Overview

This is my solution to the expanding cards mini project used to learn and test a
few HTML, CSS and JavaScript skills.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I have learned on this project more about centering a page using flexbox and a
little more about using Js to make the site more interactive.

```css
@media (max-width: 30em) {
  .container {
    width: 100vw;
  }

  .panel:nth-of-type(4),
  .panel:nth-of-type(5) {
    display: none;
  }
}
```

### Continued development

For future development, I will continue to train using the flexbox and combine
it with the grid.

### Useful resources

- [MDN - flex property](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/flex) - The flex CSS shorthand property sets how a flex item will grow or shrink to fit the space available in its flex container..

The code may not be perfect compared to my sensei @jonasschmedtman but I need
to thank him because he has shown me the ropes and now I am a confident web
designer.
