## Overview

This is my solution to the expanding cards mini project used to learn and test a
few HTML, CSS and JavaScript skills.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I have learned on this project that I should not be afraid of web design. When
you can start to see the connection between the end goal and what you have been
given you can see some connection and adapt. I used the paragraph size to help
me get a general picture of the size that I needed to use for the rest of the document.

```css
.main-content {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;

  min-width: max-content;
}
```

### Continued development

For future development, I will continue to train using the flexbox and combine
it with the grid.

### Useful resources

- [YouTube @media tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyRtI1MIjhs&ab_channel=ThuNghiem) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understanding the @media
  for mobile and the importance of creating a more responsive site.

The code may not be perfect compared to my sensei @jonasschmedtman but I need
to thank him because he has shown me the ropes and now I am a confident web
designer.
